## Implemented but Not Working Properly

- ### Paddle Extension

        - I want to make the paddle's width extends when the ball destroyed specific type of block. However when I try to work with the features, it does not work properly.
        - If the ball destroyed the specific type of brick, the paddle's width should be extended. However when i destroyed the block, the image of paddle displayed on the screen is not extended but behind the screen it is extended.
        - This cause the paddle image and paddle's real width does not match and player can catch the ball although the paddle shows in the screen did not hit the ball.
        - The features already removed from the game.

- ### Freeze the movement of ball and paddle at the start of game
        - At the beginning, this feature is implemented but does not work properly. The ball freeze and when I press on Space it will start dropping down to the paddle.
        - However when the ball hit the paddle, the speed of the ball will become very fast which should not be happened.
        - The features is now removed from game.

- ### Reset the position of ball and freeze it when loss 1 heart
        - This feature is implemented but it had same problem with the previous feature.
        - After pressing Space, the speed of the ball become too fast when hit to the paddle from dropping down.
        - This features is removed.


## Features Not Implemented

- ### Level Selection
        - Level selection feature is more designed for games with many levels.
        - The feature is left out because this game only have 17 levels and 1 bonus level. I think this is not the feature with the higher priority.

- ### Timer for challenge level
        - This features is mainly aim to motivate players to try their best to to pass a level in time given.
        - However, due to the complexity of implementing a fair timer system, I decide to prioritize other features that can improve player experience.

- ### Iron block
        - Create iron blocks that require two hits to be destroyed from the screen.
        - This is a good features to increase fun of the game. However, the idea appeared during the final stages of the game development.
        - Thus, this features is left out as there is not enough timeto add it to the game.
